## Asymptotic Notation

Analogy between asymptotic comparison of two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ and the comparison of two real numbers $a$ and $b$;

- $f(n) = O(g(n)) \approx a \le b$
- $f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) \approx a \ge b$
- $f(n) = \Theta(g(n)) \approx a = b$
- $f(n) = o(g(n)) \approx a < b$
- $f(n) = \omega(g(n)) \approx a > b$
